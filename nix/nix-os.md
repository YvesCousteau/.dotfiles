# NixOS
Learn how to configure, install, and deploy NixOS.

## NixOS virtual machines
One of the most important features of NixOS is the ability to configure the entire system declaratively, including packages to be installed, services to be run, as well as other settings and options.

NixOS configurations can be used to test and use NixOS using a virtual machine, independent of an installation on a “bare metal” computer.

> [!WARNING]
> A NixOS configuration is a Nix language function following the NixOS module convention.\
> For a thorough treatment of the module system, check the Module system deep dive tutorial.

### Starting from a default NixOS configuration
In this tutorial you will use a default configuration that is shipped with NixOS.

> [!TIP]
> On NixOS, use the `nixos-generate-config` command to create a configuration file that contains some useful defaults and configuration suggestions.
